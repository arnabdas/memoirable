We believe that, everyone should keep their experiences to meet new friends, starting new relations, having a bad day, having the most memorable day in a written format. In one's own language and with own feelings. And this written notes should not be lost. One of the problems in preserving paper diaries.

For this reason, we are building this. For you, for us. We can also pass these journals to future generations.

And of course this should remain free and private.

This app will use known and popular free storage providers like Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive to store data and will be hosted on Github pages. So, as long as you can remember the password of your Storage provider's account, your journal will be accessible for you. And ofcourse it will remain for your own eye only.

Later we may add some features like:

- Pass selective journal entries to another user
- Make a backup of your journal to local disk and restore from there. So that, you can keep your journal more safe and more personal
